Q1. How do you load a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame?
ans Import pandas as pd. df = pd.read_csv('data.csv') 
Print the DataFrame without the to_string() method: import pandas as pd. 

Q2. How do you check the data type of a column in a Pandas DataFrame?
ans Two methods used to check the datatypes are pandas. DataFrame. dtypes and pandas. DataFrame.

Q3. How do you select rows from a Pandas DataFrame based on a condition?
ans We will select rows from Dataframe based on column value using:

Boolean Indexing method
Positional indexing method
Using isin() method
Using Numpy.where() method
Comparison with other methods

Q4. How do you rename columns in a Pandas DataFrame?
ans One way of renaming the columns in a Pandas Dataframe is by using the rename() function. 

Q5. How do you drop columns in a Pandas DataFrame?
ans using drop() function

Q6. How do you find the unique values in a column of a Pandas DataFrame?
ans You can get unique values in column (multiple columns) from pandas DataFrame using unique() or Series


Q7. How do you find the number of missing values in each column of a Pandas DataFrame?
ans We can use pandas “isnull()” function to find out all the fields which have missing values.
 2.  To get how many missing values are in each column we use sum() along with isnull() which is shown below.

Q8. How do you fill missing values in a Pandas DataFrame with a specific value?
ans The fillna() method replaces the NULL values with a specified value. The fillna() method returns a new DataFrame object unless the inplace parameter is set to True

Q9. How do you concatenate two Pandas DataFrames?
ans To concatenate an arbitrary number of pandas objects ( DataFrame or Series ), use concat .

Q10. How do you merge two Pandas DataFrames on a specific column?
ans The concat() function can be used to concatenate two Dataframes by adding the rows of one to the other.
concat() can also combine Dataframes by columns but the merge() function is the preferred way.

Q11. How do you group data in a Pandas DataFrame by a specific column and apply an aggregation function?
ans we need to pass a dictionary with key containing the column names and values containing the list of aggregation functions for any specific column

Q12. How do you pivot a Pandas DataFrame?
ans The pivot() function is used to reshaped a given DataFrame organized by given index / column values

Q13. How do you change the data type of a column in a Pandas DataFrame?
ans Use astype() function to convert the string column to datetime data type in pandas DataFrame. 

Q14. How do you sort a Pandas DataFrame by a specific column?
ans You can also use the column labels of your DataFrame to sort row values. 
Using . sort_index() with the optional parameter axis set to 1 will sort the DataFrame by the column labels.

Q15. How do you create a copy of a Pandas DataFrame?
ans The copy() method returns a copy of the DataFrame.

Q16. How do you filter rows of a Pandas DataFrame by multiple conditions?
ans The loc function in pandas can be used to access groups of rows or columns by label. 
Add each condition you want to be included in the filtered result and concatenate them with the & operator.


Q17. How do you calculate the mean of a column in a Pandas DataFrame?
ans To calculate the mean of whole columns in the DataFrame, use pandas. Series. mean() with a list of DataFrame columns.

Q18. How do you calculate the standard deviation of a column in a Pandas DataFrame?
ans Standard deviation is calculated using the function . std() 

Q19. How do you calculate the correlation between two columns in a Pandas DataFrame?
ans By using corr() function we can get the correlation between two columns in the dataframe.


Q20. How do you select specific columns in a DataFrame using their labels?
ans This is the most basic way to select a single column from a dataframe, just put the string name of the column in brackets. 
Returns a pandas series. Passing a list in the brackets lets you select multiple columns at the same time.

Q21. How do you select specific rows in a DataFrame using their indexes?
ans you can use the . iloc function. If you'd like to select rows based on label indexing, you can use the . loc function.

Q22. How do you sort a DataFrame by a specific column?
ans To sort the DataFrame based on the values in a single column, you'll use . sort_values()

Q23. How do you create a new column in a DataFrame based on the values of another column?
ans You can add/append a new column to the DataFrame based on the values of another column using df. assign() , df. apply() , and, np. where() functions and return a new Dataframe after adding a new column.

Q24. How do you remove duplicates from a DataFrame?
ans Pandas DataFrame drop_duplicates() Method
The drop_duplicates() method removes duplicate rows.

Q25. What is the difference between .loc and .iloc in Pandas?
ans loc is label-based, which means that you have to specify rows and columns based on their row and column labels. iloc is integer position-based, so you have to specify rows and columns by their integer positio
